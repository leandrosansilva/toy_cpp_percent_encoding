# Simple Percentage encoding/decoding (URI encoding)

Actually for now there's only a decoder, which works fine with UTF-8 strings.

This code is not supposed to be used in production. It's just some code I wrote
for curiosity about implementing such decoder using a functional approach, using
a state machine to represent the algorithm.

It's probably veeeery slow, and I did not think about performance, just on having fun! :-)

Made using TDD as approach and Vim as text editor.
